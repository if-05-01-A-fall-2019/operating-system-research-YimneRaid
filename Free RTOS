free RTOS

1.) What’s that?
  A Real Time Operating System is an operating system that is optimised for use in embedded/real time applications. 
  Their primary objective is to ensure a timely and deterministic response to events. An event can be external, like a limit switch being hit, or internal like
  a character being received.
  The kernel type is Microkernel and it has a MIT-License.
  It is designed to be small and simple and it is written in C and consists of only 3 C-Files.

2.) some features: 
   * Designed to be small, simple and easy to use. Typically a RTOS kernel binary image will be in the region of 4K to 9K bytes.
   * Cross development from a standard Windows host.
   * includes a tickless mode for low power applications.
   
3.) History: 
   * The FreeRTOS kernel was originally developed by Richard Barry around 2003, and was later developed and maintained by Richard’s company, Real Time 
   Engineers Ltd. FreeRTOS was a runaway success, and in 2017 Real Time Engineers Ltd. passed
   stewardship of the FreeRTOS project to Amazon Web Services (AWS). Richard continues to work on FreeRTOS as part of an AWS team.
